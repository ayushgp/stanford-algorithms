This is a repository with the implementations from Stanford University's course Design and Analysis of Algorithms Part 1 and Part 2 by Prof. Tim Roughgarden on Coursera. The implementations are in C++ and Python and more will be added as I progress through the course.

### Python Implementations
1. Sorting
  * BubbleSort
  * InsertionSort
  * SelectionSort
  * ShellSort
  * MergeSort
  * QuickSort
    1. QuickSort(First element as pivot)
    2. Randomized QuickSort
    3. Deterministic QuickSort
2. BinarySearch
3. Counting Array Inversions
4. Selection Problem(Selecting the i<sup>th</sup> statisctic)
  * Deterministic Selection
  * Randomized Selection
5. Breadth First Search (Using networkX graphs)

### C++ Implementations
1. MergeSort
2. Graphs(Both Directed and Undirected)
  * Adjecency List
  * Neightbours of a node
  * Breadth First Search
  * Depth First Search 
  * Shortest Path Distance using BFS
