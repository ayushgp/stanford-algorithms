# stanford-algorithms
This is a repository with the implementations from Stanford University's course Design and Analysis of Algorithms Part 1 and Part 2 by Prof. Tim Roughgarden on Coursera. The implementations are in C++ and Python and more will be added as I progress through the course.

If you want to contribute to this repository, please make sure the files you add or update are consistent with the style used in others.

###Python Implementations
1. Sorting
  * BubbleSort
  * InsertionSort
  * SelectionSort
